# Document Research & Theme Identification Chatbot

A comprehensive document analysis system that transforms how we interact with large document collections. Built during my exploration of advanced AI applications, this project combines intelligent document processing with conversational AI to make research more efficient and accessible.

## What This Project Does

This chatbot helps researchers, students, and professionals extract meaningful insights from their document collections. Instead of manually reading through dozens of PDFs or reports, users can simply upload their documents and ask questions in natural language. The system processes everything from research papers to scanned documents, identifying key themes and providing accurate citations.

## Why I Built This

Working with large document collections has always been time-consuming. I wanted to create something that could understand not just what documents contain, but how different pieces of information connect across multiple sources. This project represents my attempt to bridge the gap between raw document storage and intelligent information retrieval.

## Core Capabilities

The system handles multiple document formats including PDFs, Word documents, text files, and even scanned images. It uses advanced OCR technology to extract text from images and applies intelligent chunking to break down long documents into manageable sections.

For analysis, the chatbot identifies recurring themes across documents and can answer complex questions that require information from multiple sources. Each response includes proper citations, making it suitable for academic and professional research.

The interface supports both casual conversations about document content and detailed analysis with precise citations. Users can also view comprehensive theme analysis dashboards that reveal patterns across their entire document collection.

## Technical Implementation

The backend leverages Google Gemini API for natural language understanding and theme identification. Document storage and retrieval use ChromaDB for efficient semantic search, while the frontend runs on Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.

Document processing incorporates PyMuPDF for advanced PDF handling, Tesseract for OCR capabilities, and OpenCV for image preprocessing. The system supports both basic document processing and advanced features like table extraction and intelligent segmentation.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies using the provided requirements file.

You'll need a Google Gemini API key, which should be added to a .env file in the project root. The system will create necessary database directories automatically when first run.

Start the application with Streamlit and access the web interface through your browser. The sidebar provides options for document upload and processing configuration.

## How to Use

Begin by uploading your documents through the sidebar interface. Choose between basic processing for simple text extraction or advanced processing for enhanced OCR and table extraction capabilities.

Once documents are processed, you can interact with them through multiple interfaces. The chat feature allows natural conversation about document content, while the individual analysis tool provides detailed citations for each source.

The theme analysis dashboard reveals patterns and connections across your entire document collection, helping identify recurring concepts and relationships between different sources.

## Project Architecture

The codebase is organized into logical components for maintainability. The main application file handles the Streamlit interface, while separate modules manage document processing, vector storage, theme analysis, and API integration.

Document processing supports multiple formats and includes fallback mechanisms for robust handling of various file types. The vector storage system provides efficient similarity search across large document collections.

Theme analysis uses AI to identify patterns and connections, while the citation manager ensures accurate source tracking throughout the analysis process.

## Dependencies and Requirements

The project relies on several key libraries for different aspects of functionality. Streamlit powers the web interface, while Google's Generative AI library handles the language processing components.

ChromaDB manages vector storage and semantic search capabilities. Document processing uses PyMuPDF for PDFs, python-docx for Word documents, and Tesseract for OCR functionality.

Additional dependencies include OpenCV for image processing, sentence-transformers for text embeddings, and various utility libraries for data handling and visualization.

## Configuration Options

The system supports flexible configuration through environment variables and processing options. Users can choose between different chunking strategies depending on their document types and analysis needs.

Processing modes range from basic text extraction to advanced analysis with OCR and table extraction. The vector storage system can be configured for different performance and accuracy trade-offs.

## Performance Considerations

Large documents benefit from the intelligent segmentation feature, which breaks content into logical sections rather than arbitrary chunks. This improves both processing speed and answer quality.

The vector database caches embeddings for improved query performance, while OCR processing is optimized for accuracy over speed. Memory usage scales reasonably with document collection size.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include support for additional document formats, enhanced table processing capabilities, and integration with other AI models for specialized analysis tasks.

The modular architecture makes it straightforward to add new processing capabilities or integrate with different storage backends as needs evolve.

## Development Notes

This project emerged from practical needs in document analysis and represents an exploration of modern AI capabilities applied to real-world problems. The codebase emphasizes readability and maintainability while incorporating advanced features.

The implementation balances functionality with performance, providing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms throughout the processing pipeline.
